        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Johannesburg, I found solace in artistry and storytelling from a young age. Whether sketching drawings or immersing myself in true crime documentaries and baking shows, I was always driven by a thirst for knowledge and understanding. My passion for education was ignited through involvement in an after-school program, where I encountered the challenges and inequalities within our education system. Determined to effect change, I turned to technology as a tool to bridge gaps and empower learners to reach their full potential. Today, I am committed to leveraging tech solutions to create inclusive and impactful learning environments, driven by a vision of equal opportunity for all.</p>
