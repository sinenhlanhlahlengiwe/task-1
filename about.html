        <div class="Education-box">
            <h4>Educational Background</h4>

    <div class="WorkHistory-box">
        <h4>Work Experience</h4>
    <p>In 2019, alongside completing my GED, I began my professional journey as a part-time salon operator, engaging clients and assisting with salon treatments and appointments. Subsequently, in 2020, I transitioned to an administrative role at a college's head office in Midrand. Concurrently, I continued my part-time role as a salon operator. In this position, I facilitated admissions, supported students in navigating e-learning platforms, and participated in student recruitment efforts. It was during this time that my interest in technology was sparked, as our college sought solutions to transition to online learning amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<div class="Projects-box">
    <h4>Projects and Future Endeavors</h4>
<p>In 2023, I delved deeper into exploring various careers in the tech industry. This led me to discover organizations in South Africa offering bootcamps and courses focused on programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and #C. While I haven't yet completed any tech-related projects. I'm eagerly looking forward to the hands-on experiences and new skills I will gain through this bootcamp.
